# Non-linear RLC Experiments

`nl-rlc-sgd.ipynb`, `nl-rlc-maml.ipynb` and `nl-rlc-reptile.ipynb` are the notebooks to run SubGD from different initializations.

`nl-rlc-paperplots` is the notebook to summarize all results of the above experiments in a combined plot.

Before you start, make sure to extract the RLC dataset files from `experiments/nl-rlc/data/*.tar.xz`.

`res/` contains a plot of the dataset that can be found in the appendix of the paper.
